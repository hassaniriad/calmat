// This is an example of a file containing the definition of an array using the [Â ]
// In this file the symbols "//" are used for comments
// So the calmat command to read this file is:
//    A = readmat(file='foo1.txt',comment='//')
// Blank lines may be added
//
 
//[ 1, 2, 3, 4.1 ; ... // The 1st row ("..." is used here as a break line)
//  5, 6, 7, 8   ; ... // The 2d row
//  9, -1, 0, 0 ]      // The last row

// Of course we also may write it on a single line: 
 [1, 2, 3, 4.1 ; 5, 6, 7, 8 ; 9, -1, 0, 0 ]
